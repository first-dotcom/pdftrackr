      {
        question: "Can a downloaded PDF be tracked?",
        answer:
          "Yes, PDFs can be tracked even after download, but it depends on the tracking method used. PDFTrackr uses link-based tracking, which means once someone downloads your PDF, you can still track when they access it through the original link. However, if they share the downloaded file directly, that activity won't be tracked. For maximum tracking, we recommend using view-only mode to prevent downloads.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can you see who has opened a PDF?",
        answer:
          "Yes, with PDFTrackr you can see detailed information about who has opened your PDFs. Our platform tracks viewer email addresses (when email gating is enabled), geographic location, device information, and viewing patterns. You'll know exactly who accessed your documents, when they viewed them, and how long they spent reading.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does PDF tracking work?",
        answer:
          "PDFTrackr uses secure link-based tracking. When you upload a PDF, we create a unique, secure URL that viewers access instead of downloading the file directly. This allows us to track views, engagement time, geographic location, and other analytics while keeping your document secure and protected.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is PDF tracking legal and ethical?",
        answer:
          "Yes, PDF tracking is legal when done transparently and ethically. PDFTrackr is GDPR-compliant and requires explicit consent for analytics tracking. We recommend informing recipients about tracking in your privacy policy and obtaining consent where required by law. Our platform includes built-in privacy controls and data retention policies.",

    questions: [
      {
        question: "How secure is PDF tracking?",
        answer:
          "PDFTrackr provides enterprise-grade security for your documents. All data is encrypted using TLS/SSL protocols, files are virus-scanned automatically, and we implement strict access controls. Your documents are stored in secure cloud infrastructure with regular security audits and compliance with industry standards.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can PDF tracking be detected by viewers?",
        answer:
          "PDFTrackr's tracking is designed to be transparent and user-friendly. While viewers can see that they're accessing a secure link, the tracking itself is seamless and doesn't interfere with their reading experience. We believe in ethical tracking that respects user privacy while providing valuable insights.",
      },
      {
        question: "What data is collected during PDF tracking?",
        answer:
          "PDFTrackr collects essential analytics data including view counts, session duration, geographic location (country level), device information, and email addresses (when consent is given). We do not collect personal information beyond what's necessary for analytics and security purposes.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long is tracking data retained?",
        answer:
          "PDFTrackr automatically deletes analytics data after 26 months, session data after 30 days, and email captures after 12 months. Our automated cleanup system ensures compliance with data retention policies and privacy regulations.",

    questions: [

        question: "What analytics can I see with PDF tracking?",
        answer:
          "PDFTrackr provides comprehensive analytics including total views, unique visitors, average session duration, page-by-page engagement, geographic distribution, device and browser information, and completion rates. You can export this data for further analysis and reporting.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I control who downloads my PDFs?",
        answer:
          "Yes, PDFTrackr offers download control features. You can set documents to view-only mode, preventing downloads entirely, or allow downloads while still tracking access. This gives you complete control over how your documents are shared and accessed.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does PDF tracking work offline?",
        answer:
          "PDFTrackr's tracking works when viewers access your documents through our secure links. If someone downloads a PDF and views it offline, that activity won't be tracked. For maximum tracking coverage, we recommend using view-only mode and encouraging viewers to access documents through the provided links.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I set expiration dates for PDF access?",
        answer:
          "Yes, PDFTrackr allows you to set custom expiration dates for your document links. Once expired, the link becomes inactive and viewers can no longer access the document. This is perfect for time-sensitive content or temporary access requirements.",

      },
      {
        question: "Is email capture mandatory for PDF access?",
        answer:
          "No, email capture is optional. You can choose to enable or disable email gating based on your needs. When enabled, viewers must provide an email address. When disabled, viewers can access documents directly without providing contact information.",
